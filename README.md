# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this program was to work the starter code of CSS and HTML and add to the script.js to write a program that would help the user create a random password. The user can create a password between 8 - 128 characters long. Once this decision is made, the user can decide what type of characters (special characters, numbers, uppercase or lowercase letters) will make up the password. Once the user responds to the prompts, the password is generated and displayed on the screen for the user to record. 

In my JS I started with notes recording the steps I needed to complete this task. In the notes I recorded where I had questions about how to complete. I searched for other random password generators to find out if anyone one else had the same approach that I did and could possibly help me with the gaps in my knowledge base. In the Credits section you will see the credits. I learned more about using arrays within a function and the logical thought process for the program - What has to happen first in order for the next step to execute. I learned that I have much more to learn and will spend even more time building a JS vocabulary foundation so I know what is possible. I learned that programmers are willing to share their ideas and approaches for which I am most grateful.

Here is a link to the <a href="https://nchoin.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/">random password generator</a> I created and below is a screenshot of the webpage and a look at the js.

## Credits


Thank to Louis Taylor. Our initial discussions about the approach to creating the password helped me formulate my plan which is outlined in the JS script.
  
Thank you Daniel Vega, who shared his approach to creating random passwords. You helped me figure out how to connect the arrays of characters with the user's input selections. You gave me the JS vocabulary I needed to finish my ideas. I appreciate your willingness to share your thoughts. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@danielvega545" target="_blank">This is his YouTube channel.</a> I used his idea of adding a function for pulling all the prompts together in a function which then which then created an array with the arrays I created for each type of charcter selected for the password. I also learned that parseInt will take a string and convert it into and integer which I needed for the array. I followed his ideas for using the getPrompts function in the generatePassword function.
